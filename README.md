# BCG-Strategy-Consulting-Virtual-Experience-Program

Welcome to BCG’s virtual experience program! 

So what exactly is a virtual experience program? It is the perfect opportunity to take on practical tasks similar to what the BCGers would work on and get a true feel of what it is like to work at BCG as a strategy consultant, & technology consultant which will gave me a deeper understanding on what BCG does and help set you up for success when you decide to apply with them.

In this virtual experience program, I have gained enviable insight into what it’s like to solve meaningful challenges with BCG's diverse and forward-thinking team. What’s great about this virtual experience program is the flexibility of it. I got to choose the module or modules that I would like to take and complete all of these tasks and modules anywhere and anytime in the world, allowing  to me to upskill myself in my own time and pace.

After finishing each module, I was be provided with real work sample answers from the leaders and I could see how top-tier consultants would have tackled each task, so that I can learn from their approach.
